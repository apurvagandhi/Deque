Assignment 3


Discussion Log: 
I started working on this lab by myself. However, I came across few challenges which I couldn't figure out. Furthermore, I worked with Troy Gleason and we discussed about an appendFront function. We discussed various possibilities as well as logic behind the function. I fixed many of the errors by adding an extra function to print out the entries in queue. Printing entries from queue really helped me in debugging this program.

I thought my program worked perfectly. However, despite it working as intended professor instructed me that this was the insufficient way to move append to the deque. I worked with Margaret Haley and we figured out append front in the most efficient way. Finally, I did not discussed with anyone else other than Troy and Margaret regarding this assignment.
